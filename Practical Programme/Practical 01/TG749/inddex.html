			Sports clubs range from organizations whose members play together, unpaid, and may play other
similar clubs on occasion, watched mostly by family and friends, to large commercial
organizations with professional players which have teams which regularly compete against those
of other clubs and attract sometimes very large crowds of paying spectators. Clubs may be
dedicated to a single sport or to several (multi-sport club).
